    - How **I do it?**
    - Why **I do it?**
descriptions:
    - "**Get to know the people.** Always keep in mind the people we’re designing for. There’s no user experience with our users.\n\n**User Experience.**  Approach design with honesty and positive intentions. Good design is inclusive, and for the people, not for the technology./n/n**Interface Design.** Create a design that’s both accessible, and beautiful. I believe in creating emotions thru design."
    - The reason why I love working as a UX/UI designer is because I've got the possibility to create a connection between people and my work, help users with their problems and make a connection by exploring creative concepts and creating experiences that fit their needs.
note:
    - I also create video games 🎮 and sometimes illustrations 🖍.
